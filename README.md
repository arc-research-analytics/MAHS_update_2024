# Metro Atlanta Housing Strategy Update

This repo contains the methodology to the [Metro Atlanta Housing Strategy update](https://metroatlhousing.org/). The Strategy includes housing policy recommendations based on findings from the regional housing market. These recommendations are tailored to specific "submarkets", which are clusters of the regioin where similar economic and housing dynamics are at play.

To create the submarkets, we used land use data from Zillow to find unique "fingerprint" proportions by Census tract. Our update utilized assessor and sales data at an address level from ATTOM Data Solutions.
